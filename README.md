# About

Repository with all my dotfiles.

# Install

Firstly, install zsh:

```
  # OSX
  brew install zsh
  
  # Ubuntu
  apt install zsh -y
```

And then [oh my zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh):

```
  sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

The installation script should set zsh to default shell, but if it doesn't it can be do it manually:

```
  chsh -s $(which zsh)
```

```
  git clone git@github.com:raphaeltelatim/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
